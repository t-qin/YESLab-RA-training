# 24 Spring RA Training 🌸
*Prepared by Shangcheng Zhao*

## OVERVIEW & PURPOSE
We will focus on online experiment preparation and data cleaning this quarter. 

## LEARNING GOALS
1. Online experiment preparation
    - Learn how to use Qualtrics: basic skills, query string, embedding data
    - Learn how to use Psychopy: Add trial and loop, add code chunk for customized function
2. Data cleaning
   - Transform data between wide and long format
   - Exclude participants according to attention check and other criteria
   - Visualization and simple analyses

## SCHEDULE
|Week | Preparation | Meeting | Homework |
|-----| ------------------ | ------- | -------- |
|Week3: 4.15 - 4.21 | - Translate two surveys for correlation study on Qualtrics | - Check translation <br> - Basic skill for Qualtric | - Set up a new ‘SAD_consent_form’ on Qualtrics, and put the translated consent form into it and practice skills (add questions, use query string) <br> - Bonus question: Now you have one survey on Qualtrics. However, how to make sure your set up for url work? Come up with a solution. For example, you can have a test survey on Qualtrics and redirect to that, then check the response in test survey <br> - Backward translation: instructions of facial trait task in correlational study |
|Week4: 4.22 - 4.28 | **Mandatory**: <br> - Download psychopy. <br> - Have python installed on your PC. <br><br> **Optional**:<br> - Learn how to use the code component in psychopy <br> - Use the public resource on pavlovia and study others’ experiments | Psychopy | |
|Week5: 4.29 - 5.05 | **Mandatory**: <br> No hw this week!🙌 <br> **Optional**: <br> If you want to practice, please refer to the *toy example* section in [Introduction_to_PsychoPy](Introduction_to_PsychoPy.md) for more information. | Psychopy:Advanced skills | [hw5](week5_hw.md)| 
|Week6: 5.06 - 5.12| Complete hw5. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions. | Sync your study to an online platform. [Useful manual](Online_Experiment_Manual.md) | 1. Setup(forward translation) Qualtrics survey <br> 2. Put backward translation into the [google form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/123Vibwe0h4kozJ2ST7ZkgvFAMB9NV7sVcF-XPLTX2tU/edit#gid=1535614195) <br> 3. check [project management sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13nRnKz6_VAiPSJmg7pHIy1ehNXtmrQUEhsCH7QHS2uI/edit#gid=841548799) for detailed instruction <br> 4. Log down any significant change in this [doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WGXqJESu8UB_LGXBWFCmK3u1EF3ioM5a7lQWOPwDrTY/edit) |
|Week7: 5.13 - 5.19| **Mandatory**: <br> - Have python installed on your PC. <br> - Have a code editor installed on your PC. I recommend [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) <br> - Tutorial for [pandas](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/pandas) and [seaborn](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/seaborn-python-tutorial) <br> **Optional**: <br> - Try to figure out the best way to control image size balance beteen showing images in the same size, avoid overlapping and distortion <br> - If you have time, download the `/data` folder in **this repository** and try to clean it to the wide format. You can see [here](Data_cleaning/correlational_study_method_description.ipynb) for study description, and [here](Data_cleaning/pilot_data_cleaning.ipynb) for sample code <br>  | Data cleaning with pandas and seaborn | Run the [script](Data_cleaning/pilot_data_cleaning.ipynb) for data cleaning <br> See [here](Data_cleaning/correlational_study_method_description.ipynb) for study description <br> **Learning goal**: <br>(1) Roughly understand each section of code <br> (2) Visualize and interpret the result. You can do more exploratory analyses. |
|Week8: 5.20 - 5.26| Finish the data cleaning homework. <br> Go through [Github tutorial](https://ucsbcarpentry.github.io/2023-10-23-ucsb-git/) before the meeting. | Interpret results based on cleaned data <br> Introduction to Github: discussion-based | Prepare for data analysis presentation |
|Week9: 5.27- 6.2| 1. Prepare for data analysis presentation <br> 2. If you have time, use either the materials on *Datacamp* or [this tutorial](https://ucsbcarpentry.github.io/2023-10-23-ucsb-git/) to learn the usage of git and github | Data analysis presentation & Introduction to github | |
Week10: 6.3 - 6.9
Week11: 6.10 - 6.16
